<body>
    <p>what if we had the chance to be children again?</p>
    <p>what if we could do the things we so longed for, things we now know we could have done but didn't know then?</p>
    <p>what if we could change the things we deeply regret?</p>
    <p>what if we had given that hug, that kiss, that caress, that laugh?</p>
    <p>today we are what we decided yesterday, but... what if what we decided yesterday had been better?</p>
    <p>perhaps today we would be better people?</p>
    <br />
    <p>how I wish I could go back to yesterday. 💔</p>
